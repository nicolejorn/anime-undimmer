# Anime Undimmer

This python script exactly removes the dim filters for a segment of an anime clip.

## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
python color_multiply.py ep15.mkv tmp.mkv 1 --only_plot
```

This will only calculate the ranges that are likely to be dimmed, and plots the max brightness per frame.
